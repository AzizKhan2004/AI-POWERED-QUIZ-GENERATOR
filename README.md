# Summary Quiz Android App

An offline-friendly Android app built with Jetpack Compose that accepts at least 200 words of study material, summarizes the context, and generates a minimum of 10 interactive quiz questions. Every session is persisted locally with Room so learners can revisit their previous content.

## Features
- ✅ **Smart text validation** – enforces the 200-word requirement with live word count.
- 🧠 **Heuristic summarizer** – extracts the most relevant sentences to create a concise study brief.
- ❓ **Automatic quiz builder** – creates 10 fill-in-the-blank multiple-choice questions with instant scoring.
- 📚 **Local history** – stores every quiz attempt (source text, summary, questions) in Room for quick recall.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** – Material 3 + Jetpack Compose with animated sections, dialogs, and score feedback.

## Getting Started
1. **Open in Android Studio**  
   - _File → Open…_ and select the `android-summary-quiz` folder.  
   - Let Gradle sync; install the recommended Android Gradle Plugin if prompted.

2. **Run on device/emulator**  
   - Use **Run > Run 'app'** to install the debug build on an attached device or emulator.

3. **Generate an APK**  
   - Debug APK: `./gradlew assembleDebug` → `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`  
   - Release APK: `./gradlew assembleRelease` (configure a signing config first) → `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

## Usage Workflow
1. Paste or type your study material (≥ 200 words).  
2. Tap **Create Summary & Quiz**.  
3. Review the autogenerated summary and answer the 10-question quiz.  
4. Open **Recent Sessions → View all history** to revisit prior content; everything is stored locally.

## Extending the App
- Replace the heuristic summarizer with a cloud LLM API call if network access is acceptable.
- Add authentication and sync the Room database to a remote backend.
- Export history as PDF or shareable text bundles for classmates.

**APK download reminder:** after running `./gradlew assembleDebug`, share the generated `app-debug.apk` from `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. Upload it to your preferred hosting (Drive, S3, etc.) to distribute the installer.***
